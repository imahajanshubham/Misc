** The problem statement
An exam is to be conducted. *N* students will give the exam. Students are numbered
as *1, 2, 3 . . N*. There are *M* questions and each question should be asked to
only one of those *N* students. The questions are numbered as *1, 2, 3 . . M*. The
conditions are that:

1. *ith* question should be asked to exactly Ai students
2. No two consecutively numbered students get the same question to solve.

Given numbers *N*, *M* and array *Ai*, find out if the questions can be assigned to students as per the given conditions.

Note that summation *Ai* will be equal to *N*.

*** Input
First line contains two space seperated integers *M* and *N*
Second line contains *M* spaced integers, *Ai* denoting the times *ith* question has
to be asked.

*** Output
Print "YES" if the questions can be arranged, print "NO" otherwise.

*** Constraints
*11* ≤ *M* ≤ *N* ≤ *10^6*
*0* ≤ *Ai* ≤ *N*

** Test Case
*Input:*
3 7
3 3 1

*Output:*
YES
