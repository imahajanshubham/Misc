                      2. Fastest-fingers First Question - Only by winning it, user can goto main game.
                      3. Option to set Minimum Target Money so that after He/She reaches their and looses,
                         They win that much amount :)
                      4. Option of Lifelines (Audience Pole, Expert Advice and Double Dip) is also available 
                         that too each Lifeline once per game.
                      5. Option to quit anywhere in the game.

          Featuring - 1. Option to choose 'X' or 'O'.
                      2. Game will ask whether you would like to move first or not.... Currently, you have to
                         move first... Haven't yet completed other part, My Apologies :)
                      3. ANother thing is that don't move in 5th Box at very start...
                         (Later on, you can move there) working on it too :)
                      4. After this, you are free to move in any Box!
                      5. To move somewhere in Box... 
                            Write and Hit enter the Box No. (Like 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or 9).
                      6. After Win/Loss/Draw... 
                            You can continue to play and your score is updated accordingly :)

###3. Paint using Arrow Keys.
          Featuring - 1. Option to choose color using keys... (Try to find out which
                              are those keys using the source code :) Hehe).
                      2. To move/print a Colored-Box on the console, 
                              Hit w/a/s/d.
                      3. To move/print a space/gap on console,
